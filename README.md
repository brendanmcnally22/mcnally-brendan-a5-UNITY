 WOO 
 Asteroids , I hope you enjoy.

I didn't know you can't win in asteroids because honestly I had never played lol. 

But the way the spawning was initially setup I thought it would be kind of clever. I saw in the rubric that the function we add should make sense to the game and for this I was like oh yeah, this is perfect.

Anyways I've added a sharpstop to help player movement control with Q, use your thruster and come to a SHARP STOP and dodge the asteroids! 

Also press left shift to change your ship color! :) 

Enjoy and thanks for the great semester!!
